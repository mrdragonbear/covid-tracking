# Assessing Mismatch of COVID-19 Contact Tracing Applications to Ethical Contact Tracing Guidelines

This repository provides documentation relevant to the manuscript "**Watching the Watchmen: A systematic review of the ethics andefficacy of digital contact tracing implementations**" by authors **Benjamin Levy** and **Matthew Stewart** published in the 2020 Harvard Data Science Review. 

This work focused on surveying the landscape of contact tracing applications and ranking these with a novel metric coined the **ethical alignment score** which assessed how well these applications aligned with ethical contact tracing guidelines outlined by the World Health Organization.
